# 🐈 Seth Linares 🐈

- 😸 Hello, I'm Seth Linares!!
- 👀 I’m interested in ML/AI, Rust, C#, Python, C++ (though Rust is really winning me over), TypeScript, React, and anything that challenges me and reminds me why I love Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop my own Vision Transformer (ViT). After finishing up with that, I plan to switch over and try to create one for audio 😎😎.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out at sethlinares1@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite chess opening with white is e4 (have to love the 'Queen's Gambit' -- it's the best opening). Also, I love cats!! 🐈‍⬛🐈
